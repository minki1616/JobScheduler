# JobScheduler


Requirements -
- The scheduler should handle executing the jobs.
- Jobs should run promptly at their timeout if nothing else is running, but it's ok to fall behind the schedule if jobs take too long to execute and block other jobs.
- Do not use any built-in schedulers for your language
